So I was on 4chan, reading posts, and somebody posted this:

"A script selects and displays an image at random from /h/, randomly
selecting a pressure, speed, and time.  This repeats until the user
clicks the "I CAME" button, after which the user is presented with
statistics about the session.

Programmers of /h/, MAKE IT SO."

I thought, "Hey, that sounds cool.  Why not?" So I made this thing.
It's open source, written in python, so feel free to poke through it
and do whatever you want with it.


Running the Program
===================
Windows: Run fg.exe
Linux, Mac OS X, etc: Run fg.py.  Make sure you have Python 2 and
wxPython installed!


Controls
========
Pause: leftclick
Random image: uparrow / downarrow / spacebar / rightarrow
Go back an image: leftarrow
Fullscreen: f / alt+return
Change pulse colour: r
Quit: q


Image History
=============
fg keeps image history while it's running, in case you really liked a
former image and wish to return to it.  Pressing leftarrow will take
you back an image.  If there are no more images in the history stack,
leftarrow will do nothing.  Image history is not persistent; it's not
saved anywhere.


Selecting Images
================
To select threads to download from, go to the Download Manager in the
context menu (right-click), click on the board you want to select from
on the left side, and check "download images from this thread" for any
threads you want to download from.  

Clicking "ignore this thread" will cause the thread to be pushed to
the bottom of the list the next time the board is loaded.

When Gif Only Mode is enabled, only gifs will be downloaded.
(whatever's in the cache will still be displayed though)

The program creates the cache/ directory, where it stores images.  If
it can't find a connection, or you haven't selected any boards/threads
with the Download Manager, it will just load images from cache/.

If you want to add files, just drop them in the /cache/ directory, and
fg will start off on those.

To add images from a folder without adding them to /cache/, select Add
Folder from the context menu (right-click), and any images in the
folder will be added.  Note that this is not recursive.


Blacklisting Images
===================
If the program picks an image you don't like, you can select Blacklist
This Image from the context menu (right-click), and the program won't
select the image for viewing in the future.  You can undo this by
deleting the "blacklisted:true" line for the image in dispdata.cfg.


Statistics
==========
To see your statistics, select "I CAME" from the conetxt menu
(right-click).  Selecting "I CAME" doesn't actually reset the
statistics, so don't worry about clicking it if you haven't actually
cum (yet).


Fap Frenzy
==========
When this mode is enabled, the pace will increase a bit after each
image is displayed.


Rendering Options
=================
To toggle scaling, select Scale from the context menu. Enabled by default.

To toggle fullscreen, select Fullscreen from the context menu or press
F or Alt+Return.  When an animated image is scaled, it will render
best in fullscreen mode.


Posting Options / Download Manager Parsing
==========================================
If the download manager sees that some of the text in the post comment
for an image is in the format "(count)/(speed)/(force)", where:
(count) is a positive number (like: 9, 20, 30)
(speed) is either a text speed (see below) or a decimal number (like
0.1, 2.0, 2.8, 9.9)
(force) is just some text

It will use those instructions for the image whenever it's displayed.
Commas, fowardslashes, and backslashes count as separators.

If (speed) is a number the speed will be the frequency of strokes (eg,
how many strokes per second) so 0.5 would be a stroke every 2 seconds,
1.0 would be 1 stroke a second, 2.5 would be 2.5 strokes a second,
etc.

A specific numeric speed can also go on its own line (surrounded by parentheses),
if you want to use a text speed in the "(count)/(speed)/(force)" line.
For example::
20, fast, light
(2.5)

Text Speeds:
valid text speeds are:
    extremely slow (1 stroke every 4 seconds, 0.25)
    very slow      (1 stroke every 3 seconds, 0.333)
    slow           (1 stroke every 2 seconds, 0.5)
    medium         (1 stroke every second, 1.0)
    normal         (1 stroke every second, 1.0)
    fast           (2 strokes every second, 2.0)
    very fast      (3 strokes every second, 3.0)
    extremely fast (4 strokes every second, 4.0)

Example:
10, extremely slow, force of 1000 suns

Automatic Speeds:
If "speed" or "pace" is mentioned in the speed field, and the image is
animated, the program will attempt to automatically determine the
proper speed.  For example:
80, same speed as gif, hard

This won't work well if the animation has multiple
strokes per playback, so in that case, it's probably best to include
the speed on it's own line.


dispdata.cfg
============
display data (count, speed, force) can be directly edited in the
"dispdata.cfg" file.  for example, the contents might look like:

file:1243134752865.gif
count:50
speed:1.563
intensity:Anything can go here! Awesome! Even alternative instructions!

file:1268748407427.gif
count:30
speed:0.833


folders.cfg
===========
folders can be added at startup by adding them to the "folder.cfg" file.


Troubleshooting
===============
If fg.exe says you're missing msvcp71.dll, there's a copy in msvcp71.zip.
Extract it into the same directory along with everything else.

If the program just displays the same image over and over, see the 
Selecting Images section.

If you notice that a gif seems to be rendering more slowly than it
should, there's a chance that the delaytime in the gif file is set
incorrectly.  This is why I included setgifdelay.py.  Run it, enter
the filename, and the delay you want to set for all the frames, and it
will set the delay for every frame to that speed.  Speed is in
centiseconds.  A good setting for the delay is about 3.  Don't pick 0,
since it's used as the indicator that the file was badly made.  The
result will be output in the same folder as the image, with
"setgifdelay_" prepended to the original image's filename.

Notes about browser rendering delay (measured in fractions of a second):
Safari:  less than 0.03 -> 0.03 (makes sense)
Firefox: less than 0.02 -> 0.10 (make some sense)
IE:      less than 0.06 -> 0.10 (make NO sense, 0.9 renders faster than 0.5)
Opera:   less than 0.10 -> 0.10 (consistently slow, probably optimal for phones
or whatever)
Google Chrome is probably the same as Safari, as they both use WebKit for 
rendering
